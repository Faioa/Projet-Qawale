# Projet-Qawale

## Presentation

This project came about in response to a problem set out in a software engineering course at Sorbonne University during our third year of undergraduate studies.

We are a team of three passionate young developers: 
- Matthieu DARTOIS
- Tiemokodjan DIAKITE
- Youness ESSABRI.

Together, we aimed to implement the board games Qawale and Quarto using Java.

## Progress

The progress of this project can be followed from its GitHub page by clicking on [this link](https://github.com/Faioa/Projet-Qawale).

At the moment, we're a long way from achieving the goals we've established. So we'll be working on weekly updates that will bring us ever closer. This file will also soon be updated with details of how the program works and how to install it. We'll be trying to make it as simple as possible for everyone to use it.

## Important notice

As of now, we don't know how to use the licenses to protect our work, but we are in no way claiming the rights to the board games implemented : this project is being developed solely in an academic context, and no profit will be made from it.
