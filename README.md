# Projet-Qawale



## Presentation

  

This project came about in response to a problem set out in a software engineering course at Sorbonne University during our third year of undergraduate studies.



The goal is to be able to play the games Qawale and Quarto on a computer. We still do not know if it will be possible to play on other platforms, but we will try to make it as finished as possible. This application will come with a graphic interface and some other options (playing online with a friend or against an AI for instances). This is an academic project, however we hope it will be a great asset on our resume to support our candidacies.

  

We are a team of four passionate young developers:

- Christelle CLERVILSSON

- Matthieu DARTOIS

- Tiemokodjan DIAKITE

- Youness ESSABRI.

  

Together, we aim to implement the board games Qawale and Quarto[^1] using Java.

  

## Progress

  

The progress of this project can be followed from its GitHub page by clicking on [this link](https://github.com/Faioa/Projet-Qawale).

  

At the moment, we reached a first significative threshold : a working game with a working graphic interface. There is still many changes and upgrades to be made and we hope to
continue working on this project in the future.


## How to play



- The first step is to download Maven on your computer (v4.0.0+).

- Then, download the files from our GitHub repository.

- Open

  

## Important notice

  

As of now, we don't know how to use the licenses to protect our work, but we are in no way claiming the rights to the board games implemented : this project is being developed solely in an academic context, and no profit will be made from it.
