# Projet-Qawale



## Presentation

  

This project came about in response to a problem set out in a software engineering course at Sorbonne University during our third year of undergraduate studies.



The goal is to be able to play the games Qawale and Quarto on a computer. We still do not know if it will be possible to play on other platforms, but we will try to make it as finished as possible. This application will come with a graphic interface and some other options (playing online with a friend or against an AI for instances). This is an academic project, however we hope it will be a great asset on our resume to support our candidacies.

  

We are a team of four passionate young developers:

- Christelle CLERVILSSON

- Matthieu DARTOIS

- Tiemokodjan DIAKITE

- Youness ESSABRI.

  

Together, we aim to implement the board games Qawale and Quarto[^1] using Java.

  

## Progress

  

The progress of this project can be followed from its GitHub page by clicking on [this link](https://github.com/Faioa/Projet-Qawale).

  

At the moment, we're a long way from achieving the goals we've established. So we'll be working on weekly updates that will bring us ever closer. This file will also soon be updated with details of how the program works and how to install it. We'll be trying to make it as simple as possible for everyone to use it.



Currently, it is possible to play both games, but we are trying to improve our code and the functionalities. It does not have an interface yet, but it will soon be resolved. We are trying many different approaches at the same time as there is a lot we are learning with this project. However, we hope to achieve our ambitions by the start of January 2024.

  

## Important notice

  

As of now, we don't know how to use the licenses to protect our work, but we are in no way claiming the rights to the board games implemented : this project is being developed solely in an academic context, and no profit will be made from it.
